Project Assessment:
    Cross-Solar is a backend web application created in a hurry by a startup company called “Green Energy Analytics” in Texas - USA.
     This application collects energy analytics data for solar panels every hour.

Notes:
    - The project accepts data for registered panels only, and to register a panel, a serial number along with latitude and longitude
     is required.
     The serial number must be exactly 16 characters in length (for ex. AAAA1111BBBB2222);
     latitude and longitude should contain 6 decimal places and must have valid values within latitude range (-90 to 90) and
     longitude range (-180 to 180) respectively.
    - The frontend application is excluded from the current scope.
    It is a separate, fully-functional application handled by another team, and we do not want to modify it.

Tasks:

    1) The frontend team want to display a panel's historical data in a chart, in which each point represents electricity
    generated by this panel each day [sum, min, max, average of hourly kilowatt values], up to the end of the previous day.

    Your goal is to implement the backend part of this task.
    The API specifications are already there in the code as agreed with the frontend team.

    2) There are a few bugs in the application that we would like you to fix.
    Even though the project might not be in a great structure, please do not spend your valuable time on structural modifications -
    just focus on fixing the bugs.

    3) Increase unit test coverage to reach 90%, achieving more than 90% will only consume your valuable time without extra score.

    PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL OF THE TASKS LISTED ABOVE ARE MANDATORY.
